                <p>A lot of the signals that we get from society today are focused on instant gratification. Make a social media post and wait for those likes, retweets and comments. Trade in forex or the stock market and get returns on the same day or even within the hour. All these things have contributed to creating ways of thinking that say we must do now and gain now. This is all leading to people putting less effort into gaining skills that can be built on and used in creative ways in many settings. That is why I think the formula to setting yourself apart from the crowd is simple. Have an attitude of constant learning and build the rare skill of being the one who goes the extra mile to create something memorable.</p>
                <p>Applying an attitude of wanting to be different is what I strive to do in learning software development. A lot of people can code and create an app that ticks all the specified boxes or passes all the predetermined tests. This has its place and can get the job done. To take it a step further, what if you can use your skills to create a new way of doing things? What if there comes a time when you are part of a project where you are the first group to solve a problem and the possibilities are unknown? The people that will thrive in that environment are those that are able to apply their knowledge in ways that can’t be taught in any course. This is the kind of developer I want to be.</p>
                <p>Breaking barriers needs good skills and a creative mind. The ability to go beyond the bare minimum will set you apart in any field. Very few people will have the attitude and tenacity to keep stretching their knowledge. Fewer still will know all the principles needed to contribute meaningfully to their teams and still be able to say that they have not “arrived”. This article is just a reflection of something that I have been thinking about and maybe even a reminder to keep an open mind and keep learning and practicing. </p>
