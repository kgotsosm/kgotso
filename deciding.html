                    <p>Starting to learn how to code can be very intimidating. The first problem you run into is trying to figure out what language to learn first. Then you must decide how you will learn the language: are you going to go into its history and get the theoretical side of it down or are you going to learn by building your own apps? Once you start learning, it feels like you are trying to fill a cup with a firehose. All of these things might contribute to people deciding to give up. This article will show you ways to keep going and build from scratch.</p>

                    <p>Nothing worth having is easy, as they say. There was nothing easy about me learning to code for the first time. For the first few months I was using a shared laptop and only had a couple of hours a day to learn. Sometimes the things I learnt the day before would be long out of my memory by the time I could practice again. I’m not somebody who was always interested in software development or tech so it took me a while to adjust to the language people use online to explain things and speak to each other. I was a complete outsider who felt way out of my depth. If I can do it then so can you.</p>

                    <p>My preferred style of learning is to build apps based on the things I know about the subject. The resources I use are:
                    <ul>
                        <li> freecodecamp.org</li>
                        <li>hyperskill.org</li>
                    </ul>
                    There are many more options but these suit my style of learning which is basically the same as throwing someone in a pool and telling them how to swim.</p>

                    <p>If you have any doubts in your journey I would strongly suggest you keep going. I am also still in the trenches and building a foundation of knowledge to grow from. The feeling of being completely stuck is one I am familiar with. This can be overcome by trying to solve the problem in any different way you can think of, use Google, StackOverflow, Reddit – just anything to help you find the answer. Failing and being able to correct your bugs is an important part of learning. The reward of finally getting the code to work is worth all that struggle in the end.
